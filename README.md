Module 6 Challenge redo - had to delete files and try again due to issues, as previously had coded without finishing and had difficulty resuming

Overview

This project is part of the Python API Challenge, where we utilize APIs to gather and analyze weather data from various cities across the globe. The primary goal is to explore the relationships between different weather parameters and geographic locations, particularly latitude.
Project Structure

The project is divided into two main deliverables:
WeatherPy: A Jupyter notebook that retrieves and analyzes weather data for over 500 cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
VacationPy: A follow-up analysis where the weather data is used to recommend ideal vacation spots.
WeatherPy
In the WeatherPy notebook, we perform the following tasks:
City Data Generation: Randomly generate latitude and longitude coordinates and identify the nearest cities.
Weather Data Retrieval: Fetch weather data for these cities using the OpenWeatherMap API.
Data Analysis: Analyze relationships between latitude and various weather metrics like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloudiness.
Visualization: Create scatter plots to visualize these relationships and add linear regression models to examine trends.
VacationPy
In the VacationPy notebook, we build upon the weather data to recommend vacation destinations based on user-defined weather preferences.

Results

WeatherPy
The WeatherPy analysis shows various relationships between city latitude and weather parameters. For example, as expected, temperatures generally decrease as one moves further from the equator (higher latitudes).
The following plots are generated:
Latitude vs. Temperature
Latitude vs. Humidity
Latitude vs. Cloudiness
Latitude vs. Wind Speed
Each plot includes a scatter plot of the data points and, in some cases, a linear regression line to highlight trends.
VacationPy
The VacationPy analysis helps identify ideal vacation spots based on user-defined weather conditions. The selected cities are then plotted on a map, highlighting potential vacation destinations.
